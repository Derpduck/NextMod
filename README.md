###### None of these changes are final. This config is still being actively worked on.

### âš  For Server Owners:
> NextMod is designed to work with the [Competitive Rework Platform](https://github.com/LuckyServ/l4d2_luckylock_server_install_public/tree/master/cfg) if your server is not set up correctly you may have to alter files in order for the config to work properly!

### â„¹ About NextMod
> NextMod is heavily influenced by community feedback, if you have a suggestion don't feel afraid to get at [me](https://steamcommunity.com/id/lonesome-spoon/).
 
NextMod is a competitive config based upon the community favourite ZoneMod, but it also brings back some of our old favourite features from other mods such as the Witch, and jump rocks, as well as some new features!

#### Main Features / Reasoning Behind Them
---
**Jump Rocks** 
Jump Rocks were added due to community requests. Tank Jump Rocks can only be done every 20 seconds. So once every 2 rocks or so.

**The Witch**
The Witch was added due to community requests and to add a bit of dynamic to the game.

**Witch Voting**
 Witch Voting was added due to the mixed feelings on Witches. Not everybody agrees with having them in the game, so adding an option to disable it only seems fair.

**Sound Removing**
Sound Removing was added to save our ears and to remove the unfair advantage some players get when they use the `snd_restart` command, while others do not.

**Health Bonus System**
The new health bonus system was added due to the amount of complaints I've heard about damage bonus. Bonus will now be determined by Perma-Health, Temp-Health, Pills, and whether or not Tank/Witch have been killed. For further detail, please read [here](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d86c7163fdf887d943947ba2accf7e74c32632e7/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f63517471747a312e706e67) or [here](https://github.com/LuckyServ/sourcemod-plugins/blob/master/source/l4d2_health_temp_bonus.sp)

**Fixed Spawn Rotations**
Spawn rotations are now handled by a plugin rather than the bestest engine ever. This means that infected spawn rotations will be more consistent, predictable and reliable, benefiting both teams!
