# NextMod - Change Log
## âš  THIS IS STILL A WIP - IT'S NOT 100% READY! âš 

### âš  For Server Owners:
> NextMod is designed to work with the [Competitive Rework Platform](https://github.com/SirPlease/L4D2-Competitive-Rework) if your server is not set up correctly you may have to alter files in order for the config to work properly.

### â„¹ About NextMod
